## Features

### Image Processing Techniques
1. **Demosaicing**
   - Edge-aware interpolation for GRBG Bayer pattern
   - Converts 12-bit RAW to RGB

2. **White Balance**
   - Gray world algorithm to remove color cast

3. **Gamma Correction**
   - sRGB gamma transformation
   - Converts 12-bit to 8-bit image

4. **Denoising Methods**
   - Gaussian Filtering
   - Median Filtering
   - Bilateral Filtering
   - Deep Learning Denoising (DnCNN)

5. **Sharpening Techniques**
   - Unsharp Mask

- Region of Interest (ROI) Analysis

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- Libraries:
  - OpenCV
  - NumPy
  - PyTorch
  - Streamlit
  - Rich

## Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/bharshavardhanreddy924/assign2.git
cd assign2
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
### Streamlit Web Application
